# flower-ID
In this project, I applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Using the Iris dataset, which includes features like sepal and petal measurements, I trained the model with k=3 neighbors.

Key steps include:

- Data Preparation: I split the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using train_test_split.
- Model Training: The KNN classifier was trained on the training data to learn species classification based on the provided measurements.
- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics.accuracy_score, which showed strong classification performance.
- Model Persistence: The trained model was saved using joblib for future use, allowing predictions on unseen data.

This project highlights my skills in machine learning, model evaluation, and deployment with Python and scikit-learn.
